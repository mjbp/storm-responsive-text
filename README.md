#Storm Responsive Text


##Browser support
This is module has both es6 and es5 distributions. The es6 version should be used in a workflow that transpiles.

The es5 version depends unpon Object.assign, element.classList, and Promises so all evergreen browsers are supported out of the box, ie9+ is supported with polyfills. ie8+ will work with even more polyfils for Array functions and eventListeners.
